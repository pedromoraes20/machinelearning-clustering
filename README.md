# machinelearning for agriculture / clustering
Although the projects I work on cannot be released, here are some details allowed for sharing. These are cases of machine learning applied in agriculture.

Area:
Clustering – Identificação de padrões de operação de máquinas

Briefing: This project is designed for agricultural machinery, but I believe it can be explored in operations in other industries. There is a difficulty for the operations management teams to assess the performance of machines, because the operating conditions vary drastically, differing by variables such as region, slope, weather (rainy, sunny), age of the asset (in years), etc. . This analysis aims, through the unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to find operational patterns to improve the management of managers' goals, in addition to returning the potential for productivity gains to the operational sector. Otherwise, this analysis also demonstrates operations that are strongly candidates for anomalies (statistically translated as outliers).

Note: The code is not complete. The parts that could identify the customer need to be removed. :(
